System
------
* Logger instead of System.out
* Faster build (reuse preprocessed files/tmp)
* Proper dist and tagging

Event System
------------
x List of Events
x Review Event Systems 
	x Processing
 	x OpenFrameworks
	x ofxUI
x Mouse Events
	x Support for different mouse buttons
* Keyboard Events
	* Notion of Focus for a widget

Class Hierarchy / API
---------------------
* Main Class (PUI)
	* Singleton vs. multiple instances
* Element Base Class / Widget
* Elements/Widgets
	* Handle Events from PUI
	* Data/State/Model
	* Presentation/Rendering/View
	* User Drawing
	* User Event handling
* Event/Callback Pattern
* User controlled drawing
* User Events
* Widget creation (without classes)
* api revision


API Revision
------------
x The matrix might be changed when the draw callback comes
x Widget Constructor: PUI as first Argument

* should UIEvents really be public? maybe just protected
* support for labeled widgets
* widget names (e.g. for label, id, auto connect)
* how to best encapsulate base widget state (active, hover, pressed, focus, ...). who needs to see it?
* how to encapsulate special element state (slider value, ...)
* user callbacks
	* which events are defined -> documented, convention onEvent
	* callback arguments (whole object, relevant value, nothing)

* element draw override (disable standard draw)
* Generator Functions for Widgets in PUI. 
* Modular Generator function:  ui.new( "com.martinleopold.pui.widget.Bang", x, y, â€¦ );
* Widgets in own package: com.martinleopold.pui.widget
* PGraphics instead of PApplet? -> Can't use events then.
