DESIGN PRINCIPLES
-----------------
* Accessibility. The library should be easy to set up and use. It should be easy and painless to quickly throw together a UI to control some parameters of a sketch. This is in spirit of the 'sketching metaphor' of processing.
* Minimalism. Graphic elements should be clean in design, easily readable and understandable. A basic but usable set of user interface elements should be provided.
* Extensibility. Allow for customizing the display of UI Elements and support creating completely new ones regardless of the type of data they represent.


IDEAS
-----
* Separate Event System Library (see ofxEvent)
* Basic Elements (Slider, Button, Toggle, Label, Divider)
* Sensible Defaults (Position, Size, Proportion)
* Grid Based Layout
* Graphical Layout Adjustment ("Edit Mode", Drag & Drop)
* Minimal Theme
* Auto connect to variables and functions (by name)
* Write your own elements (Functionality & Look)
* Accessible Documentation (see Interfascia)
* Documentation through examples
* GUI Overlay
* Save and load parameters
* Method Chaining (controlP5)
* Feedback when an Element auto-connects (console)
* Main GUI Object has a graphic representation (the overlay). When empty contains a notice that elements need to be added.
* Automatic Labels for elements
* Simplest way to create a GUI Element?
* Performance: Draw GUI in offscreen buffer. Only redraw when changed.
* Possible to avoid class syntax? (beginners!)
